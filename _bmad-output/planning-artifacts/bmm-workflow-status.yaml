# BMM Workflow Status - Quick Flow Track
# ========================================
# This tracks progress through the Quick Flow methodology
# Quick Flow: Minimal planning, fast iteration (tech-spec → implementation)

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Initial Status (before completion):
#   - required: Must be completed to progress
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#
# Completion Status:
#   - {file-path}: File created (e.g., "implementation-artifacts/tech-spec.md")
#   - skipped: Optional workflow that was skipped

# Workflow Status
# ===============
# Quick Flow has a simple 2-phase approach:
#   Phase 1: Specification (quick-spec)
#   Phase 2: Implementation (quick-dev)

workflow_status:
  # Phase 1: Specification
  quick-spec: "_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/tech-spec-lease-cost-collection.md"

  # Phase 2: Implementation
  quick-dev: required

# Workflow Details (for reference)
# ================================
# quick-spec:
#   agent: quick-flow-solo-dev
#   command: /bmad:bmm:workflows:quick-spec
#   purpose: Create implementation-ready tech specification
#
# quick-dev:
#   agent: quick-flow-solo-dev (or dev)
#   command: /bmad:bmm:workflows:quick-dev
#   purpose: Implement the tech spec task by task
